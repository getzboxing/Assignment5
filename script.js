//1.	Add a button to a web page. Use the old school HTML attribute method to attach a click event handler to the button. That handler should call a function that displays the message “I have been clicked” out into an alert box.

function myFunction() {
    
    window.alert("I have been clicked!");
}

//2.	Add a button to a web page and uniquely ID the button. Write a script that finds the button by its ID. Then use the DOM Element method to associate a function with the onclick event of the button. Again, display the message “I have been clicked” out into an alert box.
